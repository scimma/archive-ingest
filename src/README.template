# Housekeeping Software

Housekeeping uses three system elements.

- Sources which  hopskotch or mocks
- Databases which are either AWS rds Postgres of mocks
- Stores which can be AWS S3 store or mocks

Realized (i.e non-mock) elements can be either from the SCiMMA
development or producion instances as appropriate.  The softare
is such that there is a configuraton to source  production hopskotch
while developing. 


## Housekeeping.py

Housekeeping.py is the program that loads the housekeeping archive.
Housekeepling.py can be run during development against the live ements
in the deevepoment instance or mock elements. It's pososbel to use the
the production HOP as a data source in development.
